# TR_LDJDA
# LDJDA-master
Source code and all the datasets used in the paper (A Novel Discriminative Representations Learning Approach for Cross-Project Defect Prediction).

## There are the following  main subfolders in -master
-- AEEEM, NASA, Promise, and Relink--
                   These folders include the corresponding datasets used in the paper. Each dataste is a ARFF file.
-- DLJDA_method --  This folder includes the source code of DLJDA.
-- DLJDA_demo  ---  This folder includes four  demonstrations(eg.demo_AEEEM.m).
-- Full Reslut--    This document is the results of 511 cross-project defect prediction experiments.
-- R+Rank--         This folder includes the code of Scoott-Kntt ESD test with R.
